      <p>This course will use a case  study based on a fictitious Servicemember, Staff Sergeant Simon Marcus, to  illustrate aspects of the C&amp;P Muscle Injuries examination. You will have  opportunities to participate as the examiner reviews documents prior to the  examination and to view videos that highlight parts of the examination. This  case study is not intended to reflect the life or situation of any Veteran or  Servicemember, living or deceased. The role of Staff Sergeant Marcus is  portrayed by an actor, but the examiner in this case study is a practicing VA  physician who volunteered in the development of this course and video.</p>
		    <p> Simon Marcus, a photographer  and longtime Army Reservist, was called to active duty for Desert Storm,  Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). During his  Afghanistan deployment, Staff Sergeant Marcus was injured in a mortar attack.  Shrapnel from the blast punctured his upper right arm. Staff Sergeant Marcus  was treated over several months in Afghanistan, Germany, and the United States.  He recently filed a claim for disability compensation for muscle injuries.</p>
		    <p>This completes the  introduction to the course. The first lesson begins on the next page and  provides you with an overview of the C&amp;P Muscle Injuries examination. </p>
