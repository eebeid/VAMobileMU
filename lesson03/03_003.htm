	    <p>For an initial C&amp;P Muscle  Injuries examination for an original claim for service connection—as is the situation with the course case study—you should be prepared to work through a complete chronological history of the claimed condition, including the onset,  course, treatment, and response to treatment. For an increase or review  examination, the medical history should cover the interval from the last C&amp;P examination. The medical history for a C&amp;P  Muscle Injuries examination should include the following information:</p>
	    <UL type="disc">
	      <LI>Verify the dominant hand.</LI>
	      <LI>Verify the type and date of injury or infection, the type of treatment provided, and the response.</LI>
	      <LI>For residuals of wounds, obtain the history of initial injury, whether or not hospitalization was required and length of stay, whether there was debridement or other surgery, whether there were infections before and after healing, and any subsequent hospitalizations related to the wound.</LI>
	      <LI>Elicit descriptions of pain and severity of pain, swelling, inflammation, stiffness, fatigue, lack of endurance, locking of muscles or joints, giving out or giving way of muscles or joints, uncertainty of movement, and frequency and severity of flare-ups.</LI>
	      <LI>Review treatments for alleviating pain.</LI>
	      <LI>Ask about devices for preventing further injury, including braces, wraps, or other means of support.</LI>
	      <LI>Determine whether or not the Veteran or Servicemember is receiving follow-up care.</LI>
	      <LI>Ask about specific effects of muscle injury residuals on the Veteran's or Servicemember's ability to perform job functions and daily activities.</LI>
	      <LI>For neoplasms, obtain the specific diagnosis, date of diagnosis, treatment used, and whether treatment has been completed.</LI>
