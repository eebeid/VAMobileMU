	    <p>Now that the medical history interview  is finished, the examiner focuses on considerations for the physical  examination. The examiner has already verified that a measuring tape and  goniometer are available in the examination room.</p>
	    <p>The examiner knows that the  injuries requiring C&amp;P Muscle Injuries examinations are difficult to  evaluate due to possible overlapping damage to muscle, tendons, nerves, and  bones. Disabilities resulting from these wounds can result in functional loss  affecting range of motion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance. These  disabilities may be caused by anatomical damage, pain, adhesions, defective  innervation, or other pathology.</p>
	    The examiner is aware that  some muscle conditions may be painful, so he will alert Staff Sergeant Marcus  before he touches him. The examiner will assess and grade muscle strength using  a scale similar to the one on the next page.</DIV>
