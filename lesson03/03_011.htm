<p>When you finish the physical  examination, invite the Veteran or Servicemember to ask questions. Should he or  she ask you about the possible outcome of the claim, explain that this is not a  decision you can make. Let him or her know your role is to perform the  examination and send your findings to the Veterans Benefits Administration  (VBA) so they can make a decision on his or her claim. State that the  examination report is very important but is just one piece of evidence that VA  will consider in deciding the claim. The Veteran or Servicemember should be  reminded that VBA will notify him or her of the decision. </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that  there are topics you should avoid discussing with Veterans or Servicemembers  during any part of the examination:</p>
<UL type="disc">
  <LI>Merits of the claim</LI>
  <LI>Whether or not a disability should be service connected</LI>
  <LI>Likely outcome or benefits resulting from the examination</LI>
  <LI>Opinion regarding relationship of the disability to service</LI>
  <LI>Whether or not a previous determination was correct</LI>
  <LI>Treatment recommendations for other than emergent conditions</LI>
</UL>
<p>The examiner will keep  these precautions in mind as he closes the case study examination for Staff  Sergeant Marcus on the next page. </p>
