	    <p>Completing  your documentation as soon as possible after an examination will help keep your  report accurate. Your documentation is not complete until you have addressed  all claimed conditions by providing your examination findings and pertinent  test results. Include the chronological history of treatment. Once a diagnosis  has been confirmed, describe current signs, symptoms, and physical findings,  especially functional limitations or impairments, related to the muscle  conditions.</p>
      You'll also want to refer  to the Examination Request as you write your final report. This practice will  help you meet adjudication requirements. Before signing off on your report,  check to ensure you addressed all instructions or questions posed in the  Remarks section of the Examination Request. Remember to always document whether  or not the C-file was forwarded to you and reviewed by you.	  </DIV>
