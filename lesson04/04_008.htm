	    <H3><STRONG>When  to Provide a Medical Opinion</STRONG></H3>
	    <p>No  opinion was required for Staff Sergeant Marcus's examination, but there are  important considerations for medical opinions when you are asked to provide  one. In most cases, an opinion should be given only when the Examination  Request requires it or if the evidence of record necessitates providing an  opinion. For example, the evidence of record might require a medical opinion to  explain findings such as a diagnosis that differs from previous diagnoses. </p>
	    <H3><STRONG>Follow  the Examination Request</STRONG></H3>
	    <p>If an  opinion is requested on an Examination Request, review the Examination Request  carefully to ensure that all required information is supplied and your opinion  addresses only the information needed. Avoid expressing an opinion regarding  the legal merits of any claim or the percentage evaluation that should be  assigned for a disability. Adjudicators will make those determinations based on  your examination findings and other evidence.</p>
	    <H3><STRONG>An  Adequate Opinion</STRONG></H3>
      <p>An adequate opinion for  C&amp;P purposes is a responsive conclusion supported by a thoughtful, logical,  robust rationale based on medical literature, when feasible, and all available  evidence. It should address how and if a Veteran's or Servicemember's medical  issues are related to his or her military service or respond to other specific  questions posed on the Examination Request.      </p></DIV>
