	    <H3><STRONG>Discrepancies in Diagnosis</STRONG></H3>
	    <p>You  may find conditions in your examination that differ from or contradict previous  diagnoses in the Veteran's or Servicemember's records. If this situation  arises, document the new diagnoses and provide a well-reasoned rationale for  the change in diagnosis, including any pertinent examination or test results.  It's also helpful to use available lay statements from the Veteran or  Servicemember to document a condition.</p>
	    <H3><STRONG>Discrepancies  in Reported Symptoms</STRONG></H3>
	    <p>If you feel that reported symptoms  are not supported by the physical examination, test results, or observations,  include a statement similar to this one in your examination report: "No  objective findings to support a diagnosis of the claimed muscle condition."  "Normal" is a valid diagnosis. Along the same lines, if the findings do not  support the level of severity suggested by the complaints, explain in detail why. Record the  Veteran's or Servicemember's own unprompted language as his or her statements  and not your conclusions. Remember, however, the Veteran or Servicemember is  qualified to describe his or her muscle symptoms, as he or she is able to see  and feel the condition.</p>
