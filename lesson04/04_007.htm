	    <p>You should give as much  information as possible on the effects of a condition on daily activities and  any occupational activities, whether or not the claimant is currently employed  or regardless of type of occupation. Consider only the impact of the claimed  condition with an emphasis upon the limitation of activity imposed by the  disabling condition (38 CFR 4.10).</p>
	    <p>Example:<BR>
	      Unable to sit in one place  for more than an hour and a half due to back pain.</p>
	    <p>Report your professional medical  impression, taking into consideration the Veteran's or Servicemember's  statements. What the Veteran or Servicemember says may help you to assess the  functional impact of the condition.</p>
	    <H3><STRONG>Functional Impact Remark</STRONG></H3>
	    <p>Here is an example from our  case study of how to report the functional impact of a disability. Notice that  the functional impact remark is in the form of a statement from Staff Sergeant  Marcus. </p>
	    "Servicemember  reports that he is unable to do any heavy lifting such as lifting a full  garbage can."
