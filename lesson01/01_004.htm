	  <p>As you know, C&amp;P examinations serve a legal purpose. This  topic will include both muscle injuries and musculoskeletal injuries, with  guidance from title 38, part 4, of the Code of Federal Regulations, VA's  Schedule for Rating Disabilities.</p>
	  <p>For the purposes of this  course, the cardinal signs and symptoms of muscle disability are loss of power,  weakness, lowered threshold of fatigue, fatigue-pain, impairment of  coordination, and uncertainty of movement  (38 CFR 4.56).</p>
	  <p>If on examination you discern that a muscle injury affects the  functioning of a joint, you will need to address the affected joint with the  appropriate documentation protocol. Please note that some regulations have  acquired broader applications from court decisions, such as 38 CFR 4.59. This regulation discusses  considerations for arthritis that have been interpreted by the courts to apply  to musculoskeletal injuries.</p>
	  <p>Musculoskeletal injuries are discussed further on the next page.</p>
