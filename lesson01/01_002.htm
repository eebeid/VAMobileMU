      <p>A C&amp;P Muscle Injuries  examination is different from a treatment examination in terms of the purpose  of the examination and the audience for the examination report.</p>
      <p>The Veterans Benefits  Administration (VBA) requests a C&amp;P examination when a Veteran or  Servicemember files a claim for compensation or pension and the record does not  contain sufficient information for an adjudicator to make a decision on the  claim. The C&amp;P Muscle Injuries examination is a legal, forensic examination  requested by VBA to provide clinical information needed to assist VA in  determining a claimant's entitlement to benefits. The audience for the  documentation you provide from a C&amp;P examination is primarily VA  adjudicative staff, including Rating Veterans Service Representatives (RVSRs)  and Decision Review Officers  (DROs), and if the claim is appealed, attorneys and judges. The information  requested from you, the examiner, is based solely on adjudication needs and not  on treatment considerations.</p>
<p>By comparison, the purpose  of an examination for treatment is to provide a diagnosis and determine  appropriate treatment for a patient. The audience for a treatment examination  report is primarily other clinicians.</p>
