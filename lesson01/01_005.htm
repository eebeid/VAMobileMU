	  <p>VA defines a musculoskeletal disability as primarily the inability  to perform normal working movements of the body as a result of damage or  infection in parts of the musculoskeletal system. When there is damage or  infection in parts of the musculoskeletal system, an individual may be unable  to move the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and  endurance (38 CFR 4.40).</p>
    <p>When assessing  musculoskeletal disability, it is essential to evaluate functional loss  attributable to the disability. The functional loss may be due to absence of a  part, or all, of the necessary bones, joints, and muscles, or associated  structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective innervation, or other  pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology, and  evidenced by the visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion (38  CFR 4.40). To this end, the facial expression, wincing, etc., on pressure or  manipulation, should be carefully noted and definitely related to affected  joints. Muscle spasm should also be recorded to assist the adjudicator.  Crepitation either in the soft tissues such as the tendons or ligaments, or crepitation  within the joint structures should be noted carefully as points of contact  which are diseased. As flexion elicits such manifestations, the joints involved  should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing  and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite  undamaged joint (38 CFR 4.59).</p>
