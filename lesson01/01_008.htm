	  <p>The VA rating schedule (38 CFR 4.73) identifies 23 groupings of muscle structures in the human body. These muscle groups are not commonly used outside VA but they are very important for purposes of evaluating muscle disabilities for VA rating purposes. Each group is identified by a Roman numeral. For example, Muscle Group I comprises the trapezius, levator scapulae, and serratus magnus muscles, which control upward rotation of the scapula and elevation of the arm above the shoulder level, while Muscle Group VII comprises the flexors of the carpus and long flexors of the fingers and thumb, as well as the pronator. These muscles are described as controlling flexion of the wrist and fingers and helping pronate the forearm. For rating purposes, it's important for the clinician to identify each muscle group affected. With penetrating wounds, including chest and abdominal wounds, you must identify each muscle group traversed by the projectile.
