	  <p>In the <EM>DeLuca v. Brown</EM> case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for  Veterans Claims  (CAVC)  found  that the method of assessing musculoskeletal disabilities that are rated based  on limitation of motion was inadequate, as VA examinations did not adequately address  additional limitation of function of joints that might occur due to weakness,  excess fatigability, or incoordination, or to pain on use or during flare-ups. As a result of the <EM>DeLuca</EM> case, these additional factors must be  considered for each joint examined to ensure that functional impairment is not  underestimated: </p>
	  <OL>
	    <LI>Pain on movement that limits function during  repetitive use and flare-ups</LI>
	    <LI>Weakened movement</LI>
	    <LI>Excess fatigability</LI>
	    <LI>Incoordination</LI>
      </OL>
	  <p>You should assess for each of  these and report in the number of degrees, if feasible, additional loss of  motion of the joint as a result of one or more of these factors. The absence of  any or all of these factors should also be noted.</p>
	  Example: After using a  roller to paint for 20 minutes, the Veteran is unable to raise his arm above  shoulder level due to pain and fatigue.
