	  <p>The <EM>Mitchell v. Shinseki</EM> (2011) case  expanded upon the evaluation criteria outlined by the CAVC in <EM>DeLuca</EM> (1995) by heightening VA's duty to consider limitation of joint function due to  flare-ups or with repetitive use.</p>
	  <p>For a C&amp;P examination, a  flare-up is generally regarded as any temporary or recurring significant  increase in signs or symptoms associated with the condition. If there are flare-ups of joint disease that affect  limitation of motion of a joint, you should report the duration, frequency, and  severity of the flare-ups as described by the claimant. Based on the <EM>Mitchell v. Shinseki</EM> decision, you also  need to provide the following information:</p>
	  <OL>
	    <LI>Describe whether pain, weakness, fatigability,  or incoordination could significantly limit functional ability during  flare-ups, or when the joint is used repeatedly over a period of time.</LI>
	    <LI>Describe any such additional limitation due to  pain, weakness, fatigability, or incoordination. If feasible, this opinion  should be expressed in terms of the degrees of additional range of motion loss  due to pain on use or during flare-up.</LI>
	    <LI>If such opinion is not feasible, please state so  and provide an explanation as to why the opinion regarding additional  limitation during flare-up or when the joint is used repeatedly over a period  of time cannot be rendered. <BR>
        </LI>
      </OL>
	  <p>Note that for each examination you need to provide this  information for<EM> <STRONG>both</STRONG></EM> flare-ups and when the affected joint is  used repeatedly over a period of time, not just after three repetitions. </p>
	  Example: After three hours  in a photo session, Staff Sergeant Marcus is unable to raise a camera to a  90-degree angle above his shoulder due to increased pain and fatigue.
