	  <p>In cases of severe muscle  disabilities affecting the hand, foot, or buttocks that rise to the level of  loss of use, the claimant may be entitled to additional compensation. This  additional compensation, known as special monthly compensation<sup>1</sup> <A id="_ftnref1" title="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"></A> (SMC), is an additional monthly monetary payment, over and above any disability  compensation that may otherwise be paid. One of the relevant regulations, 38 CFR 4.63, for example, defines loss of use of  a hand or foot, for purposes of special monthly compensation, as existing when  there is no more effective function than would be possible if there were to be  an amputation at the site of election below elbow or knee with a prosthesis in  place. This by no means implies that an amputation needs to be indicated or  recommended in order for loss of use to be present. It means that there is very  limited remaining function of a hand, based on grasping, manipulation, etc., or  of a foot, based on balance, propulsion, etc., to the extent that function  would be comparable to, or at least no better than, the function that could be  obtained by means of a prosthesis.</p>
	  <p>Another  regulation, 38 CFR 4.64, defines loss of use  of both buttocks, involving severe damage to muscle Group XVII bilaterally.</p>
