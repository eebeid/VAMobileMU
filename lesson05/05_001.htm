	  <p>Congratulations!  You have completed the DMA Muscle Injuries Examination course. You may use the  course Menu to navigate to any lesson as needed before you proceed to the Final  Assessment that follows this summary. In four lessons, this course provided the  following content.</p>
	  <H3><STRONG>The C&amp;P Muscle  Injuries Examination</STRONG></H3>
	  <p>This lesson discussed the  scope and purpose of the C&amp;P Muscle Injuries examination and the  differences between an examination for treatment and a C&amp;P examination for  legal purposes. The lesson also explained your role as a C&amp;P examiner.  Legal aspects of the examination, including reporting requirements, loss of  use from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and <EM>DeLuca</EM> and <EM>Mitchell</EM> criteria were also covered.</p>
	  <H3><STRONG>Before the Examination</STRONG></H3>
	  <p>This lesson described  preparation for a C&amp;P Muscle Injuries examination. The focus was on the  review of documents that may include the Examination Request, the C-file, all  available medical records, and the documentation protocol required for the  examination. Direct any questions regarding these documents to the regional office (RO) or Appeals Management Center (AMC)  before the examination, if possible. The case study was supported by an Examination Request and a summary of  details gathered from the C-file by the examiner.</p>
