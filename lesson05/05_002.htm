	  <H3><STRONG>Conduct the  Examination</STRONG></H3>
	  <p>This  lesson focused on processes and techniques for conducting a C&amp;P Muscle  Injuries examination. Videos based on the case study with Staff Sergeant Marcus  demonstrated highlights of the case study examination. Considerations for the  medical history interview and for assessing muscle strength were discussed and  an examination walk-through detailed important steps. The lesson concluded with  tips for closing the examination, ordering any necessary diagnostic tests, and  addressing questions concerning the claim.</p>
	  <H3><STRONG>Document the  Examination</STRONG></H3>
	  <p>In the last lesson, you were  provided instruction for documenting a C&amp;P Muscle Injuries examination.  This lesson covered the basic requirements for a C&amp;P examination report,  including substantiating any diagnosis you make, and addressing discrepancies  in diagnoses or between objective findings and a claimed condition. Guidelines  for reporting a medical opinion were also provided. Finally, you were told that  you need to be aware of your facility's requirements for the release of  documents.</p>
	  <p>The course Final Assessment  is next. We hope you have enjoyed the course and wish you the best in the Final  Assessment. Thank you for your participation.</p>
