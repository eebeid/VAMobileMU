00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,970
Hi, I am Rick Ivnik. I am the 

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,230
Director of Biomedical Engineering 

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,500
at the St. Louis VA Healthcare 

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,400
System. I am here today to talk to 

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,800
you about biomedical engineering 

6
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,530
for informaticists.

7
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,270
The purpose of this presentation is 

8
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,130
to provide you with a basic 

9
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,770
understanding of the roles, 

10
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,430
responsibilities, and functions of 

11
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,730
Biomedical Engineering in the VA 

12
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,730
and how the relationship with 

13
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,370
Biomedical Engineering and 

14
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,000
Informatics is extremely important 

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,230
to the future of healthcare.

16
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,730
The learning objectives are 

17
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,330
primarily to identify the roles, 

18
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,600
responsibilities, and functions of 

19
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,930
Biomedical Engineering in the VA, 

20
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,570
to understand the healthcare 

21
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,330
technologies that Biomedical 

22
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,500
Engineering manages, and to define 

23
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,570
the relationship between Biomedical 

24
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,570
Engineering and Informatics. This 

25
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,230
hopefully will lead you to be able 

26
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,330
to recognize opportunities to be 

27
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,430
able to work collaboratively 

28
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,570
between Biomedical Engineering and 

29
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,030
Informatics. 

30
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,700
Our core function in Biomedical 

31
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,100
Engineering, simply put, is to 

32
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,300
provide support to advance patient 

33
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,500
care by applying engineering, 

34
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,200
technical, and managerial skills to 

35
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,730
healthcare technologies.

36
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,370
The fundamental theorem we are 

37
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,500
going to discuss is that in 

38
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,270
biomedical informatics, the person 

39
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,530
and the technology are greater than 

40
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,400
the person alone. Essentially, if 

41
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,270
we can offer the person a resource 

42
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,270
that is something the person does 

43
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,130
not already know, they can provide 

44
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,630
better care to the patient. 

45
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,630
This diagram describes the 

46
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,670
relationships that are required for 

47
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,170
this theorem to hold. Essentially, 

48
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,000
when you have a patient, you have 

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,570
two interactions with that patient. 

50
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,000
The patient interacts with the 

51
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,570
medical technology and the clinical 

52
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,430
staff, both of which gather data 

53
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,470
from the patient. That data is then 

54
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,230
stored in another system. In order 

55
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,800
for these relationships to work 

56
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,500
correctly, Biomedical Engineering, 

57
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,700
OIT (Office of Information & 

58
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,300
Technology), and Informatics must 

59
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,100
work as one. 

60
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,970
Now, the reason biomedical 

61
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,030
engineering and informaticists can 

62
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,000
work so closely together is we have 

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,270
some very similar characteristics. 

64
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,870
For example, Informatics is a 

65
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,700
data-driven organization. They love 

66
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,700
data. It is what they work with. 

67
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,130
Biomedical Engineering is very 

68
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,400
analytical. We enjoy looking at the 

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,000
data and doing analysis. 

70
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,330
Informatics, you can give them a 

71
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,730
problem, and they will be able to 

72
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,370
diagnose it. If you give engineers 

73
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,300
a problem, we will attempt to solve 

74
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,100
it. Informatics understands process 

75
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,100
and workflow. We understand 

76
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,070
computers and technical systems. 

77
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,330
Informaticists are able to see the 

78
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,030
connections and clinical impacts 

79
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,600
that technology can provide. 

80
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,270
Biomedical Engineering, we are able 

81
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,000
to visualize complex processes and 

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,470
the interactions with other systems 

83
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,630
for those equipment. Informaticists 

84
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,800
are curious. Engineers are curious. 

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,330
Informaticists have the ability to 

86
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,330
communicate and translate with the 

87
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,970
clinical staff, and biomedical 

88
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,400
engineers have the ability to 

89
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,330
communicate and create diagrams of 

90
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,270
process flows on the administrative 

91
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,200
side of the house. Informatics does 

92
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,630
change management, and Biomedical 

93
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,970
Engineering does project management. 

94
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,800
In a recent survey of Informatics 

95
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,500
staff across the VA, one of the 

96
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,900
most surprising things we found out 

97
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
is they want to work with 

98
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,930
Biomedical Engineering. Eighty-five 

99
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,030
percent of Informatics staff across 

100
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,000
the VA identified that they want to 

101
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,230
share experiences and have closer 

102
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,400
integration with Biomedical 

103
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Engineering as a priority goal.
